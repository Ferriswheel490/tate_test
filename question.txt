    SET the question csv to panda reading the csv from file

    SEEK to the first line in the question csv

    GO to the next line in the question csv


    FOR every line in the question csv:

        LOOP forever:

            SET user input to empty string

            DISPLAY the 5th row on the line at the center of the screen


            WAIT for user to type input in the center of the screen:

                HANDLE events for keypresses and update user input

                IF Enter key is pressed, exit the loop

                RENDER the current user input in the center of the screen
